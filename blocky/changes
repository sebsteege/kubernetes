# Because blocky is a stateless application all configuration for the app is contained within the values.yaml configuration file
# When we make changes to the values.yaml file we must upgrade the helm chart and then restart the pods

helm upgrade blocky k8s-at-home/blocky -f values.yaml --namespace blocky
kubectl rollout restart deployment blocky -n blocky

# verify rollout restart
kubectl rollout status deployment blocky -n blocky

# A less gracefull method if needed 
kubectl scale deployment blocky --replicas=0 -n blocky
